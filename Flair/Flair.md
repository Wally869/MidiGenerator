## Flair

Creating a model to add "flair", aka some small additions to a melodic or harmonic line.
For example adding a trill/shake (what's known as a trille in French)

2 cases:
- Adding notes as ornaments (for example, repeating part of a chord, or adding anticipation to a note)
- Replacing what is currently in place by a different thing (most obvious example is to replace note by trille)


### Implementation  
Create a Flair class
will have a model to be applied, and rule set
